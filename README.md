# PLocGAN
It's a generative-adversarial-network-based model called PLocGAN, which could generate protein fluorescence images with quantitative fraction annotation to alleviate the insufficiency of quantitative fraction of protein expression.
# Dataset
There are two data sources. One is the real dataset, which can be accessed by 'https://murphylab.cbd.cmu.edu/software/2010_PNAS_Unmixing/', and the other comes from subcellular section in the Human Protein Atlas (HPA, https://proteinatlas.org).
